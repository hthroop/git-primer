## a primer on version control using Git and GitHub

This repository features presentation [slides](https://srearl.github.io/git-primer/) for a mini-workshop on the use of version control given to a group of investigators at Arizona State University in summer 2024. The slides augment the core of the workshop content, which is based on the [SciComp Workshop - Collaborative Coding with GitHub](https://nceas.github.io/scicomp-workshop-collaborative-coding/) workshop developed by N. Lyon and A. Chen at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis.
